## 📖 Project Overview

**EVision** is an AI-powered EV charging station tracker designed to solve common problems faced by EV users, 
such as long waiting times, unclear station availability, and inefficient charger selection.

The system combines **interactive maps**, **smart filters**, and an **AI-based recommendation engine** to assist 
users in making fast and informed charging decisions.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

EV users often face:
- Uncertainty about charging station availability  
- Long waiting times at busy stations  
- Difficulty choosing between AC and DC chargers  
- Lack of intelligent station recommendations  

**EVision** addresses these issues by providing a smart, data-driven charging station selection system.
